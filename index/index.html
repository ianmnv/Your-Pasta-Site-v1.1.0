              SO FROM WHERE DOES PASTA COME FROM AND WHAT IS IT MADE OF?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Many people may already know that pasta comes from Italy, but
              there's evidence that noodles were the first type of 'pasta' that
              existed in the world that came from Asia and through time they
              started to move around until they arrived in Italy. When 'noodles'
              step on Italy, the italian people experimented with it and they
              end up doing amazing sauces with 'noodles' that then they called
              as 'pasta'.
              <br />
              <br />
              Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of
              wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or
              other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or
              legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of
              wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a
              gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple food of Italian
              cuisine.
